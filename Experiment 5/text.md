Steps to Configure the Edge Impulse:

1. Create an Account and New Project:
    • Sign up for an Edge Impulse account.
    • Create a new project from the dashboard.

2. Connect a Device:
    • You can use a supported development board or your smartphone as a sensor device.
    • Follow the instructions to connect your device to your Edge Impulse project.

3. Collect Data:
    • Use the Edge Impulse mobile app or the Web interface to collect data from the onboard sensors.
    • For a "Hello World" project, you could collect accelerometer data, for instance.

4. Create an Impulse:
    • Go to the 'Create impulse' page.
    • Add a processing block (e.g., time-series data) and a learning block (e.g.,classification).
    • Save the impulse, which defines the machine learning pipeline.

5. Design a Neural Network:
    • Navigate to the 'NN Classifier' under the 'Learning blocks'.
    • Design a simple neural network. Edge Impulse provides a default architecture that works well for most basic tasks.

6. Train the Model:
    • Click on the 'Start training' button to train your machine learning model with the collected data.

7. Test the Model:
    • Once the model is trained, you can test its performance with new data in the 'Model Testing' tab.

8. Deploy the Model:
    • Go to the 'Deployment' tab.
    • Select the deployment method that suits your edge device (e.g., Arduino library,WebAssembly,container etc.).
    • Follow the instructions to deploy the model to your device.

9. Run Inference:
    • With the model deployed, run inference on the edge device to see it classifying data in real-time.

10. Monitor:
    • You can monitor the performance of your device through the Edge Impulse studio.
